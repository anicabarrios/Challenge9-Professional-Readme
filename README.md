# Challenge9-Professional-Readme
## Description

Every good project needs a quality README with information about the app - what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input about your project. Check out the README.md in output folder of this repo as an example.

## Table of Contents (Optional)


- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

To generate your own README, git clone the repo down to your local so you have the Node project on your local.

Run npm install in order to install the following npm package dependencies as specified in the package.json and inquirer will prompt you for your inputs from the command line.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
